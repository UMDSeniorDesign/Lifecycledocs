-still getting error, example scenario:
	1-after creating new project and naming the files
	2-select a section that contains a default para
	3-select edit, then add new para (should be correct with next index)
	4-click edit again, change the text in the new para, and click save (should save correctly)
	5-click edit again, change the default para text, and click save (should also save correctly)
	6-click edit one more time, change the text in the new para again, and click save (saves wrong para)

	+seems like the wrong para is getting isNewest set to false (ie its setting the attribute isNewest to false on the para with the wrong index)
	+it does add the new text with the correct index, but when it changes the wrong isNewest, that para disappears
	+






-fixed error when adding para's. when using the edit menu, and left-clicking 'add para', the para always contained index 0. when the index should be respective of it's position amongst other para's in the section.
--This isn't fixed, I simply told you about the error, please attempt to address this if the save is fixed
---I was wrong, this does work.


-fixed notionalXSL to show para's in order by index for each section, as they were listed in the order they appeared in the xml.


-need to fix save paras!
--The textarea paras need an index so they can be compared to the correct xml para
