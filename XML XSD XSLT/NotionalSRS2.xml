		<Title>Introduction</Title>
      <Para>The Software Requirements Specification details the extent of NUWC’s Lifecycle Project Manager. The product’s main feature is it’s ability to create and manage lifecycle documents using a graphical user interface. The lifecycle documents will be organized and exported using an XML Schema. This can be accomplished by a user who has no knowledge of the XML language. This document will review all the basic functionality required for a user to edit, create, and manage lifecycle projects.
	  </Para>    
		</Section>
		
		<Section id="RQ1.1">
			<Title>Purpose</Title>
			<Para> To provide a detailed description of how the product will produce it’s lifecycle documents as well as edit and export them. It also overviews the basic functional requirements requested by the customer.
			</Para>
		</Section>
		
		<Section id="RQ1.2">
			
		<Title>Scope</Title>
		<Para>The Lifecycle Project Manager will create and edit projects and lifecycle documents. It will serve as a cheap but easy to use software that allows users to input their own data and organize based on an XML schema. The product will export the lifecycle documents as PDF and HTML, as well as print out a requirements traceability matrix.

		<Title>Overview</Title>
		<Para>The SRS contains explicit details describing how the product is designed and implemented. It is organized in a top-down layered approach. The goal of this project is to create a protoype application capable of allowing a user to productively manage lifecycle documentation in XML without an previous XML experience.

  	<Title>General Description</Title>
  	<Section id="RQ2.1">
	<Title>Product Perspective </Title>
  	<Para>Our project team design goal is to develop a software solution to the proposal offered by NUWC. The design will accommodate for previous user complaints and shortcoming. It will also replace manual spreadsheet entries into a database. The software will also automate the process of generating a RTM. It will be a new, self-contained, web-based solution that requires minimal constraints. The design goal is to provide a tabular method of viewing multiple documents simultaneously to promote user productivity.
  	</Para>
  		
  	</Section>
  	<Section id="RQ2.2">
  		
  	<Title>Product Functions </Title>
  	<Para>The software will prompt the user to open a new project or create a new one. When the user selects new project it presents the user with a set default templates which have been checked against a defined XML schema. These templates will be saved with the filename specified by the user. The user can then edit these templates with their information. The user can define requirements which will be traced throughout other documents in the project. After the documents have been saved, the user can select to create a RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix) from the XML templates which the user has created and modified. 
  	</Para>
  	</Section>
  	<Section id="RQ2.3">
  	<Title>User Characteristics</Title>
      <Para>This product is intended to be used by a non-technical user who may have no knowledge of the XML language. There will be no user groups, or administrator authentications. The user will be assumed to have access once the user is able to log into the computer where the software is stored.
      </Para>
  	</Section>
  	<Section id="RQ2.4">
  	<Title>General Constraints</Title>
     
      <Para>The software will run on a Microsoft Windows 7 platform within Microsoft Internet Explorer browser. </Para>
	  
      <Para>The use of a database is prohibited and there is also no Internet connection available.</Para>
	  
	  <Para>The software must implement an XML schema developed by the team. The schema helps keep the document structured and search-able. </Para>
	  
	  <Para>By using an XML schema and an XLST processor, the user will have the ability to export documents as either an HTML or PDF.</Para>  
  	</Section>
  	<Section id="RQ2.5">
  	<Title>Assumptions</Title>
      <Para>One dependency would be the available browser. If this were to change our application may break or provide an unintended appearance or functionality to the user.</Para>
	  
      <Para> product will create a directory for all of the created/edited LC documents, and the user will have permission on the local machine for the software to function as intended.</Para>
	  
	  <Para>The team must also assume the user is capable of creating and editing technical documentation. </Para>
	  
	  <Para>Lastly, one major assumption is user has no knowledge of XML and the user should have not have to see what is happening behind the scenes while creating the project and exporting the documents.

  		<Title> User Interfaces </Title>
		<Para>The user interface should be easy to use and have simple text boxes and an active table of contents menu, and a preview of the document selected in a preview pane. Since the user is unaware of the XML back end implementation, a GUI must be driven from XML to allow for easy adaptation.
