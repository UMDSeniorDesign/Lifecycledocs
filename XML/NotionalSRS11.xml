    <Intro>
      <Para>The Software Requirements Specification details the extent of NUWC’s Lifecycle Project Manager. The product’s main feature is it’s ability to create and manage lifecycle documents using a graphical user interface. The lifecycle documents will be organized and exported using an XML Schema. This can be accomplished by a user who has no knowledge of the XML language. This document will review all the basic functionality required for a user to edit, create, and manage lifecycle projects.

	<Scope sectionID="1.2">
		<Para>The Lifecycle Project Manager will create and edit projects and lifecycle documents. It will serve as a cheap but easy to use software that allows users to input their own data and organize based on an XML schema. The product will export the lifecycle documents as PDF and HTML, as well as print out a requirements traceability matrix.

  <GeneralDescription sectionID="2.0">
  
	<Title sectionID="2.1">Product Perspective </Title>
  	<Para>Our project team design goal is to develop a software solution to the proposal offered by NUWC. The design will accommodate for previous user complaints and shortcoming. It will also replace manual spreadsheet entries into a database. The software will also automate the process of generating a RTM. It will be a new, self-contained, web-based solution that requires minimal constraints. The design goal is to provide a tabular method of viewing multiple documents simultaneously to promote user productivity.
  	</Para>
  	<Title sectionID="2.2">Product Functions </Title>
  	<Para>The software will prompt the user to open a new project or create a new one. When the user selects new project it presents the user with a set default templates which have been checked against a defined XML schema. These templates will be saved with the filename specified by the user. The user can then edit these templates with their information. The user can define requirements which will be traced throughout other documents in the project. After the documents have been saved, the user can select to create a RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix) from the XML templates which the user has created and modified. 
  	</Para>
    
  	<Title sectionID="2.3">User Characteristics</Title>
      <Para>This product is intended to be used by a non-technical user who may have no knowledge of the XML language. There will be no user groups, or administrator authentications. The user will be assumed to have access once the user is able to log into the computer where the software is stored.
      </Para>
    
  	<Title sectionID="2.4">General Constraints</Title>
     
      <Para>The software will run on a Microsoft Windows 7 platform within Microsoft Internet Explorer browser. </Para>
	  
      <Para>The use of a database is prohibited and there is also no Internet connection available.</Para>
	  
	  <Para>The software must implement an XML schema developed by the team. The schema helps keep the document structured and search-able. </Para>
	  
	  <Para>By using an XML schema and an XLST processor, the user will have the ability to export documents as either an HTML or PDF.</Para>  
    
	
  	<Title sectionID="2.5">Assumptions </Title>
      <Para>One dependency would be the available browser. If this were to change our application may break or provide an unintended appearance or functionality to the user.</Para>
	  
      <Para> product will create a directory for all of the created/edited LC documents, and the user will have permission on the local machine for the software to function as intended.</Para>
	  
	  <Para>The team must also assume the user is capable of creating and editing technical documentation. </Para>
	  
	  <Para>Lastly, one major assumption is user has no knowledge of XML and the user should have not have to see what is happening behind the scenes while creating the project and exporting the documents.

  		<Title sectionID="3.1.1"> User Interfaces </Title>
		<Para>The user interface should be easy to use and have simple text boxes and an active table of contents menu, and a preview of the document selected in a preview pane. Since the user is unaware of the XML back end implementation, a GUI must be driven from XML to allow for easy adaptation.

  		<Title sectionID="3.1.2">HardwareInterfaces</Title>
  		<Para> The application will be able to operate on a modern Microsoft Windows operating computer, that has an active installation of Microsoft Internet Explorer. Since there will be no network connection available, there is no requirement to interface to a network, however, the software solution will be web-based and address some scalability issues. All other hardware interfacing will be handled by the operating system, or the browser.
